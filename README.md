# Format-converter

Dicom2Nifti.py allows to automatically change the format of a DICOM series of images to NIfTI

format_converter.ipynb allows to automatically change the format of a STL segmentation to a binary NIfTI file (considering a NIfTI or DICOM reference volume to match dimensions). For using it, it is important to have latest version of Slicer (https://download.slicer.org/) and SlicerJupyter (https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerJupyter) installed
